your ability to have energy for your work, to have knowledge to
direct your work, foundations to work from, and the passion

something, to listen to your inner voice. it tends to be useful! \n

often true enough where it serves them... \n 
this card is the whispering snake in your ear, leading you astray. this is the
parent or boss or leader in your life who says they know best for you.
they are so certain that they own the truth, and you struggle to see them as 
anything but authority. they claim to be right oon things they don't even

it's compromise, it's handholding, it's missing one another when you're
apart but still being alice without them. the lovers is love. that

takes this time alone to find divine truth, enlightenment, 
signified in his lantern even in the dark. \n 
even if people stress you out, and they do me, the enlightenment
gained in being alone is sometimes not worth the lonlieness.
this can sometimes mean a temporary retreat to be alone, to
learn alone, to reflect. it can other times mean being apart  from
the world, feeling separated and distant. if you have felt alone
lately, this may be a kind reminder to think about what you
learned from the experience. isolation need not be painful.'''

it as the wheel of the seasons or time, it's not about that. it's about
a fucked up carnival ride that is total chaos, spinning and throwing you

approximating it to start anew can be done, but it is most often folly. \n

can't return to how things were. suck it up, bud, you can clear the

find the biggest growth, movement. \n

smallest ways, our lives are always changing. and that's beautiful. we
can't hold onto anything too close. sometimes good friends become

with improper form, with foolish intentions, destroying good things and

certainly making the wrong decision.'''

stems fro feelings of being overwhelmed, anxiety, fears, or just leads
to those things and a new stressor, the need to hide. \n

direction, the reverse may mean further retreat into that isolated state.

a pyrrhic victory. your demand to keep going, your failure to recognize

kept getting more expensive the further you pushed. \n

intentions. was this need to chase your self-creativity worth the lives

was it worth it?'''

the good part of this card, though, is that the youth you bring to the role
lets you speak out against things more readily, share your quick wit, and
begin planning out things before you engage with them. however this youth
can also lead you to share information too freely, spreading gossip or
being inquisitive to a fault.'''

transformation of things in your life into other things. buying new

change is eternal, it's always happening. it'll never stop. but that

"bone fire is about looking into your eyes, in a mirror, for at least
29 seconds everyday. the bone fire is a card to tell readers to 
burn away that which keeps one from oneself." \n 
i have come to understand that it's about losing everything else that
has been weighing on you and walking away with only what survives the
fire. look up ringsel in buddhism. the pearls left behind from cremated
masters, said to be concentrated enlightenment or sould. bone fire
wants you to know it's time to do that to yourself, to your own life.
throw your things in the fire and only walk away with what survives.
bone fire is not destruction or a tower card. it's not happening
to you, it's something you do on your own to yourself. I don't see a
reverse to the fire, nor do I need one. \n

vigorous with bees/in it's motionless/yellow suit/a blinding hour on
